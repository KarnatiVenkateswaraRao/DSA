//Painter's Partition Problem
//Problem Description
//Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. Element C[i] represents length of ith board.
//You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of board.
// Calculate and return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board. NOTE:
//1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
//2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. Which means a configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.
//
//Return the ans % 10000003.
//
//
//Problem Constraints
//1 <= A <= 1000
//1 <= B <= 106
//1 <= N <= 105
//1 <= C[i] <= 106
//
//
//Input Format
//The first argument given is the integer A.
//The second argument given is the integer B.
//The third argument given is the integer array C.
//
//
//Output Format
//Return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board % 10000003.
//
//
//Example Input
//Input 1:
// A = 2
// B = 5
// C = [1, 10]
//Input 2:
// A = 10
// B = 1
// C = [1, 8, 11, 3]
//
//
//
//Example Output
//Output 1:
// 50
//Output 2:
// 11
//
//
//
//Example Explanation
//Explanation 1:
// Possibility 1:- same painter paints both blocks, time taken = 55 units.
// Possibility 2:- Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, time take = max(5, 50) = 50
// There are no other distinct ways to paint boards.
// ans = 50%10000003
